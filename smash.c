/*
Every function you write must have a function header describing the arguments, return value and what the function does.
Use modular design liberally. This is a large program.
You should have a readme file with the following:
     A description of what features your shell implements
     A description of what features you attempted to implement but were unsuccessful
     Any bugs or things you want me to know about your program
          I am much more forgiving of reported bugs than bugs I discover while testing
     A copy of every function header
     An example of the readme file can be found in the github repository for this assignment
This project should use separate C files as necessary.
The project should be built using make and a makefile, I will only compile by using make. 

Try starting with these restrictions on input:
     To make your life easier, you could require that all items on the command line are to be separated by a single space.
     When parsing the line, it might help to count the number of tokens (individual pieces), before parsing.
     You can restrict the locations and ordering of > and <. 
     You can limit piping (|) to a single pipe.
